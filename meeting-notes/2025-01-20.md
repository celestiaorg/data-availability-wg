            # Reconstruction Window Plan

## Goal

Define the **reconstruction window** and discuss its implementation.

## Current Problem

Light Nodes (LNs) currently store 30 days of samples plus full headers. With 32MB (256 ODS size) blocks, this requires ~26GB per month (0.9 * 30) according to `Nashqueue` calculations.

### Lumina Disk Usage (from Maciek)

**24-hour syncing + DASing**:

- **Chrome**: ~825.5MB (93×93 square)
- **Firefox**: ~3.6GB (93×93 square)

**1-hour syncing + DASing**:

- **Chrome**: ~35.7MB (103×103 square)
- **Firefox**: ~178MB (107×107 square)

**1-hour without signatures and validator set**:

- **Chrome**: ~19.4MB (~45% reduction)
- **Firefox**: ~87.5MB (~50% reduction)

## Proposed Solution

**Reconstruction window**:

- Defines the period during which blocks must be reconstructable.
- Specifies how long Light Nodes (LNs) maintain block samples for data reconstruction.
- Does not impact the network’s fundamental 30-day data availability assumption.

**Outcome**:

1. LNs can delete samples and trim headers outside of this pruning window.
2. The **default** LN pruning window for samples is set to match the "reconstruction window" (e.g., 1 day). This defines which LNs count as contributors to block reconstruction.
    - This window can be configured between 0–30 days, but 1 day is the recommended default.

## Security Considerations

- Blocks become unreconstructable after 1 day.
- **BEFP** is limited to a 24-hour window.
- Consensus weak subjectivity remains at 21 days.

## Technical Requirements

1. Reduce the pruning window on Light Nodes (configurable; defaults to be determined).
2. Add dataroot proof support in the **SHAWP** protocol (node server side).
3. Consider a separate network topic for LNs that do not want to contribute to data retrievability (“ultra-light” mode).
4. Implement header trimming to dataroot only:
    - Confirm if `blockhash` is needed (check with C node).
    - `go-header`
    - `lumina`

## Conclusion

- **Reconstruction window** = not strictly defined (not required).
- **Sampling window** = 30 days.
- **LN pruning window** = 0–30 days.

`go` nodes can retain more data.  
`lumina` can keep less (e.g., <1 day).

It may be useful to expose the pruning window in network crawlers or configuration.

`lumina` must adjust its pruner to allow a pruning window shorter than the sampling window.

## Aftermath

Further discussion on Slack introduced the idea of splitting the pruning window into two separate configurable parameters:

1. **Header Pruning Window**
2. **Sample Pruning Window**

**Argument for**:
- Users may want to minimize sample storage while retaining headers for faster historical queries.

**Argument against**:
- Keeping things simple with a single parameter is preferable, especially since extensive historical queries are not a common use case for light nodes.
