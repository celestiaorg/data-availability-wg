Welcome to the Data Availability (DA) working group. The purpose of this group is to facilitate discussion amongst teams and individuals working on problems related to data availability on the Celestia network.

## Getting Started

The WG would encourage you to familiarize yourself with [the core values of the Celestia social layer](https://forum.celestia.org/t/core-values-of-the-celestia-social-layer/1151) as a pre-requisite to engaging in working groups and the CIP process.

# Scope Of Working Group

- Coordination around network wide parameters and their changes
- Communication and debate on potential network breaking changes
- Discussion of behavior around data storage formats and messaging schemas
- Agreement around data storage and availabilty guarantees
- Specifications and contracts regarding node types
- Support and coordination of teams/projects implementing DA nodes

Discussion of interfaces and end user APIs is out of scope for DA working group. We'd encourage that discussion to take place in the interfaces working group.
